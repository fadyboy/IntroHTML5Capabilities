# Intro to HTML5 Capabilities

The complete code example in this repo was developed and presented by one of our members at a recent meetup.

Also, thanks to another member for taking the time to document and share these steps for Cloud9 users.

To run from Cloud9, you need to do the following:  

1. All files in proper directories  
2. Open index.php  
3. Select Run at the top right with the green arrow  
4. Window will open below and Apache server will start  
5. Copy the URL address that shows in the window below where it says Apache has started.  
6. Open a new web page and paste the URL.
